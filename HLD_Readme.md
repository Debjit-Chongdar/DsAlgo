Fundamentals:   
    - Server Less (AWS Lambda)
    - ServerFul (EC2)

DataBases : 
    - SQL (Share lock, exclusive lock)
    - NoSql
    - TimeSeriesDB (Time scale)
    - In-Memory DB
    - Data Replication
    - Data Partitioning
    - Sharding

Consistency vs Availability:
    - Data Consistency and it's Level (Eventual, Qurum)
    - Isolation and it's Level  (UnCommited, need commited, repetable need)
    - CAP Theorem

Cache:
    - Redis, Memcached, EhCache
    - Write policies: write back, through, around
    - Replacement Policies: LFU, LRU, Segment LRU
    - CDN

Networking:
    - TCP
    - UDP
    - http & https
    - FTP (not secured, no encryption)
    - SMTP / IMAP (send/receive mail)
    - Web Socket (client to server & server to client)
    - WebRTC & video streaming (underlying UDP peer to peer , client to server & server to client & client to client, video conference)
    - WebRTMP (underlying TCP, webinar) 
    - server send events
    - long polling
    - Web hook
    - Api calls (client req for data)

Load Balencer:
    - Load balancing Algo (Stateful vs Stateless)
    - Consistent Hasing
    - Proxi vs Revers Proxi
    - Rate Limiting (Token bucket, Licky bucket, )

Monoliths vs Microservices:
    - Why Microservices ??
    - concept of "Single point of failure"
    - Avoiding cascading failure
    - Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

Monitoring and Logging:
    - Logging events & monitoring metrics
    - Anomaly detection

Security:
    - Token for Auth
    - SSO vs OAuth
    - Access control lits & Rule engine
    - Encryption

System design tradeoff:
    - Push and Pull architecture
    - Consistency vs Availability
    - SQL vs NoSql
    - Memory vs Latency
    - Throughput vs Latency
    - Accuracy vs Latency

Practice:
    - Youtube, Netflix
    - Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram
    - Uber
    - Amazon
    - DropBox/GoogleDrive
    - Zoom
    - Booking.com/AirBNB
